In a large project such as Git or Irmin, keeping in mind the system abstraction required to be compatible with MirageOS, one question transcends all levels:</p><pre>&gt; How to abstract the network?</pre><p>In the specific context of Unix/<code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code>, several functions exist to communicate across the network. In particular the idea of a <em>socket</em>. For most projects, the <em>socket</em> seems to be the common denominator for all transmissions.</p><p>In the case of Git, the <em>socket</em> can represent a simple TCP/IP connection or a transmission through SSH (using a pipe). For HTTP with TLS, the principle remains the same as long as OpenSSL proposes an equivalent of the <em>socket</em> through a derivation of the TCP/IP socket.</p><p>As a proof, <code>Lwt_ssl</code> proposes this same derivation:</p><pre><code class="ml">Lwt_ssl.embed_socket : Lwt_unix.file_descr -&gt; Ssl.context -&gt; Lwt_ssl.socket</code></pre><p>In any case, it seems that the <em>socket</em> principle itself is the common denominator to protocols like Git, HTTP or SMTP.</p><p>It happens that MirageOS offers an interface that describes this <em>socket</em>:</p><pre><code class="ml">sig

end</code></pre><p><b>NOTE:</b> <code>read</code> is a method that diverges from the <code>read</code>/<code>recv</code> we're used to seeing with <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> where the latter requests a buffer to write to. Historically, the idea of <code>Mirage_flow.S.read</code> gives the ability to implement a <em>zero-copy</em> stack. Indeed, the <code>Cstruct.t</code> that is returned could directly be the memory page having the TCP/IP packet. Thus, between the TCP/IP driver (the implementation) and the client application, there should be no allocation. However:</p><ul><li>it is not known if this assertion is still true</li><li>it doesn't correspond to anything real for TLS (where there is necessarily a copy)</li></ul><p>With this interface, it can be possible to abstract the socket for protocols like HTTP, Git/Smart or SMTP such as:</p><pre><code class="ml">module SMTP  = Make_SMTP  (Tcpip_stack_direct.TCP : Mirage_flow.S)
module HTTP  = Make_HTTP  (Tcpip_stack_direct.TCP : Mirage_flow.S)
module Smart = Make_Smart (Tcpip_stack_direct.TCP : Mirage_flow.S)</code></pre><p>It turns out that <code>ocaml-tls</code> offers a derivation from a given <em>socket</em> described through <code>Mirage_flow.S</code> to a &quot;new&quot; <em>socket</em> with TLS:</p><pre><code class="ml">Tls_mirage.Make : functor (_ : Mirage_flow.S) -&gt; Mirage_flow.S</code></pre><p>Therefore, it is possible to upgrade our protocols <b>statically</b> with a TLS layer quite easily:</p><pre><code class="ml">module TLS = Tls_mirage.Make (Tcpip_stack_direct.TCP)

module SSMTP = Make_SMTP (TLS)
module HTTPS = Make_HTTP (TLS)</code></pre><p>The problem with this kind of abstraction is the eminently static aspect of this code. Indeed, the choice between SMTP and SSMTP (HTTP or HTTPS) cannot be made when choosing statically these modules.</p><p>This implies that if the type of transmission depends on a value such as an <code>Uri.t</code> (and its <em>scheme</em>), we need to have access to these 2 modules throughout our process.</p><p>Especially since <code>SSMTP</code> or <code>HTTPS</code> are themselves directed by an arbitrary choice which is to use <code>ocaml-tls</code> instead of OpenSSL. It may be essential to let the user choose his TLS implementation.</p><p>We would therefore need:</p><ol><li>a functor for the TCP/IP stack (required for MirageOS)</li><li>a functor that is itself a functor waiting for our common denominator, the socket, and that can derive it into a TLS transmission</li></ol><pre><code class="ml">module type Make_SMTP =
  functor (Socket : Mirage_flow.S) -&gt;
  functor (Tls : functor (Socket : Mirage_flow.S) -&gt; Mirage_flow.S) -&gt;
  sig ... end</code></pre><p>Thus, we ensure:</p><ol><li>the possibility to <b>statically</b> choose the TCP/IP stack</li><li>the possibility to <b>statically</b> choose the implementation of the TLS layer</li><li>a way to communicate with TCP/IP within our <code>Make</code></li><li>a way to communicate with TLS within our <code>Make</code></li><li>to propose a function making the <b>dynamic</b> choice between these 2 types of transmission</li></ol><pre><code class="ml">module Make_HTTP (Socket : _) (Tls : _) = struct
  module Tls = Tls (Socket)

  let connect uri = match Uri.scheme with
    | Some &quot;https&quot; -&gt; Tls.connect ...
    | Some &quot;http&quot; -&gt; Socket.connect ...
end</code></pre><p>The problem remains in any case the eminently dynamic aspect of the choice of the transmission protocol which requires a static knowledge of what is a <em>socket</em> and what is a <em>socket</em> with TLS. The problem applies as much for Git with SSH.</p><p>This static knowledge required of the modules implementing the <em>socket</em> as well as its possible derivation into a TLS <em>socket</em> puts us in a difficult position when we want to keep the abstraction power of the functors to be compatible with MirageOS - in which neither the TCP/IP nor the TLS implementation can be known globally in advance (in other words, their implementations can only be obtained through a functor).</p><p>In MirageOS, all this complexity of the functors can be reduced with the help of <code>functoria</code> which allows to apply the functors cleanly according to the target. For the example, the TCP/IP stack depends on the target at all since with <code>mirage configure -t unix</code>, we use the host system stack but for <code>mirage configure -t hvt</code>, we use <code>mirage-tcpip</code>.</p><p>Unfortunately, this implies to &quot;keep&quot; this level of abstraction for all libraries depending on our SMTP/HTTP/Smart implementation if they want to keep the compatibility with MirageOS.</p><p>A &quot;shift&quot; on the functors then occurs systematically which leads to an exponential progression of the number of functors as one advances from layer to layer.</p><p>For example, Irmin with Git will have to integrate at the same time:</p><ul><li>a functor for the TCP/IP stack</li><li>a functor for TLS (which itself is a functor on the TCP/IP stack)</li><li>a functor for the HTTP stack which is a functor on the TCP/IP and the TLS stack</li><li>a functor for SSH which itself is a functor on the TCP/IP stack</li><li>and we are talking about communication (you can include the hash algorithm, the format of your values, etc.)</li></ul><p>It is only through all of these functors that we can:</p><ol><li>be perfectly abstract</li><li>always be able to propose a &quot;dispatch&quot; of these protocols in a dynamic way</li><li>never arbitrarily choose an implementation or more specifically a type representing these <em>sockets</em></li></ol><h3 id="the-solution."><a href="#the-solution." class="anchor"></a>The solution.</h3><p>After this &quot;brief&quot; introduction, it is now time to talk about the solution! But it seems clear that if we wanted to essentialize the problem, it would simply be to say:</p><pre>&gt; how to get a protocol implementation dynamically and without functors?</pre><p>In the previous explanations we mentioned <code>Mirage_flow.S</code>. It turns out that it is canonical to any transmission protocol. It allows to describe the TCP/IP protocol, the TCP/IP protocol with TLS or the SSH protocol because in these 3 cases, we only want to:</p><ul><li>read</li><li>and write</li></ul><p>The abstraction does not work however when it comes to instantiating the <em>socket</em>. Indeed, a TCP/IP transmission only requires an IP address and a port. However, SSH requires much more such as an RSA key.</p><p>Conduit 2.0 assumes that these instantiation methods must be known statically. An ADT describes these methods and if it is not exhaustive, it corresponds to the usual cases such as HTTPS or SSMTP.</p><p>However, we could also say that for protocols like SSMTP or HTTPS (or SMTP or HTTP), these instantiation methods are not our concern. Again, we would just like to be able to read and write.</p><h3 id="implement-a-protocol-with-mimic."><a href="#implement-a-protocol-with-mimic." class="anchor"></a>Implement a protocol with mimic.</h3><p>In the end, mimic provides an implementation of <code>Mirage_flow.S</code> that is directly usable without functors. So we will start implementating a simple protocol, a ping-pong to show how to implement a protocol (like HTTP, SMTP or Smart) with mimic.</p><pre><code class="ml">open Rresult

It's <code>Mimic.resolve</code>.</p><p>It was said earlier that the instantiation of a <em>socket</em> is not the privilege of the protocol itself. Indeed, once again, as far as our ping-pong protocol is concerned, our &quot;line-directed&quot; protocol (just like SMTP or HTTP again) does not care how to initialize a transmission. It just wants to be able to read and write.</p><p>Thus, <code>Mimic.resolve</code> seems a bit magical but the instantiation of a <em>socket</em> ultimately depends on a single value, the <code>ctx</code>. The context is a representation of what is allowed to do according to the end user. It contains elements that allow the famous dynamic &quot;dispatch&quot; to instantiate a <em>socket</em>.</p><p>In other words, it is through the context that we determine the type of transmission: if it is a TCP/IP or TLS transmission for example.</p><p>We will then see how to define this context and how it works to choose this or that type of transmission. The important thing to keep in mind is that we have just done:</p><ol><li>implement our ping-pong protocol - at least, the client part</li><li>this code will not change when it comes to upgrade the transmission with TLS</li><li>this code is compatible with MirageOS</li></ol><p>The logic of this code is very simple, it passes what it has from an <code>in_channel</code> to the server and that's it! It is important to understand that what follows must be external to the implementation of the protocol itself, because we will start to explain to mimic the instantiation of the transmission techniques.</p><p>As a concrete example, <code>ocaml-git</code> is separated in 3 where <code>git</code> implements the Smart protocol, <code>git-unix</code> registers the Unix specific transmission types and <code>git-mirage</code> does the same with MirageOS compatible implementations (<code>mirage-tcpip</code>, <code>tls-mirage</code> or <code>awa-ssh</code>).</p><p>This part will directly depend on the said transmission protocols like TCP/IP or TLS. These choices are therefore outside the implementation of the ping-pong protocol itself.</p><h3 id="registration-&amp;-instantiation."><a href="#registration-&amp;-instantiation." class="anchor"></a>Registration &amp; Instantiation.</h3><p>Mimic offers a way to &quot;fill&quot; the context with values. These values are needed to instantiate one of your transmission protocols. As we said, for TCP/IP, the instantiation of a <em>socket</em> requires to get an IP address and a port.</p><p>So, if we &quot;fill&quot; our context with these values, mimic can initialize a TCP/IP connection. More generally, 2 steps are necessary for mimic to establish a transmission:</p><ol><li>know the transmission protocol and what it requires</li><li>add what it requires in a context</li></ol><p>The first step is quite unusual. It consists in &quot;registering&quot; a transmission protocol with mimic. This is a prerequisite for extending the protocols available through mimic - and of course, initially, mimic does not know any protocols (again, to be compatible with MirageOS).</p><p>It is accepted, as we said from the beginning, that a transmission protocol can described with <code>Mirage_flow.S</code>. As for <code>mirage-tcpip</code>, <code>ocaml-tls</code> or <code>awa-ssh</code>, all three implementations respect the <code>Mirage_flow.S</code> interface.</p><p>And this is what mimic expects, a protocol that respects <code>Mirage_flow.S</code>. However, mimic expects an extension to this interface. Indeed, beyond being able to relay the <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> of your implementations to the implementation of your ping-pong protocol, mimic also depends on an &quot;instantiation&quot; method. In other words, mimic requires a module respecting <code>Mirage_flow.S</code> and a <code>connect</code> function: <a href="Mimic__/Mirage_protocol/module-type-S/index.html"><code>Mimic.Mirage_protocol.S</code></a>.</p><p>Let's take <code>mirage-tcpip</code> as an example.

In fact, if mimic really wants to be a means of abstracting transmission protocols, one must admit the idea that instantiating a protocol may require writing something. This is the case for TLS which performs a <i>handshake</i> with the server at instantiation. Thus, we must allow <code>connect</code> to return a writing error.</p><p><code>tcp_edn</code> is a value that represents what is required from our <code>connect</code>. Its type depends explicitely on the way our implementation instantiates our socket. In other words, in our example, its type is:</p><pre><code class="ml">val tcp_edn : (TCP.t * Ipaddr.t * int) Mimic.value</code></pre><p>This <i>witness</i> is useful to &quot;fill in&quot; a context that we could then pass to our client.

Giving the client a context containing the information required to instantiate a TCP/IP socket causes mimic to be able to execute <code>TCP.connect</code> with these arguments.

It may be &quot;simple&quot; to manage the domain name &quot;localhost&quot;, but behind this resolution, the process is more complexe than one might imagine. It can be similar to a DNS query on the network. Of course, this kind of mechanism does not exist - at least not without wish - with MirageOS.

First of all we note the use of <a href="Mimic/index.html#val-merge"><code>Mimic.merge</code></a> which allows to merge 2 contexts to obtain only one. To avoid code repetition, we will reuse <code>ctx01</code> which contains our DNS resolver.</p><p>Then we add the scheme from the given <code>Uri.t</code>.</p><p>To launch a TLS server, nothing more than:</p><pre><code class="ml"># openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
    -days 365 -nodes
# openssl s_server -key key.pem -cert cert.pem -accept 4343</code></pre><p>As for our client, we need to compile it with:</p><pre><code class="ml">$ ocamlfind opt -thread -linkpkg -package \
    mimic,bigstringaf,cstruct,ke,tcpip.stack-socket,uri,tls-mirage,\
    mirage-crypto-rng.unix main.ml
$ ./a.out tls://localhost:4343/
&gt; ping
#ping
#pong
&lt;- pong
&gt; ^D
#DONE</code></pre><p>And that's it! Again, as an example, the extension from one protocol to another is completely transparent to the protocol ping-pong logic. As you can see, mimic is very minimal but it allows a lot of things. The ability to integrate complex processes into the context allows us to extend what we are able to handle.</p><p>Of course, the minimal aspect of mimic is in the spirit of MirageOS. In the end, mimic only allows one thing: re-implementing virtual methods for modules. The discrimination of available implementations in what is comparable to a <i>vtable</i> (in C++) is done for the context.</p><p>Finally the functions that are in the context can fail as well. In this case, mimic tries other solutions. This situation explains another parameter used in our exemple for TLS, the priority. This ensures that even if the required information for <code>tcp_edn</code> exists, mimic will first try to instantiate a TLS transmission (if, again, all information is available).</p><p>We can finally apply to implement the server now.</p><h3 id="the-server-side."><a href="#the-server-side." class="anchor"></a>The server side.</h3><p>Mimic make the choice to let the user the way the server is made. Indeed, there is a real difference between a client and a server. There is a dynamic part in the choice of the transmission protocol as a client but it is especially not the case for the server where we know exactly how to launch our server.</p><p>Indeed, everything that is initialization or the logic of the main loop remains outside mimic. However, mimic intervenes at one point. As a server, it has to manage clients that do both reading and writing. It can be interesting to implement the client management, the &quot;handler&quot; or the &quot;callback&quot; with mimic.</p><p>The goal is to implement this logic with mimic and we will explain the way to pass from a TCP/IP or TLS socket to a <a href="Mimic/index.html#type-flow"><code>Mimic.flow</code></a>. We call this process: <em>injection</em>.</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> we will redefine <code>TCP</code> and <code>TLS</code> to use the TCP/IP stack of the host system directly this time using <code>Lwt_unix.file_descr</code>. Besides showing another example of how to &quot;register&quot; other protocols, we are required to do this for the simple reason that <code>mirage-tcpip</code> offers a different server logic/interface. Indeed, for Unix/<code>&lt;unistrd.h&gt;</code>, we are used to the triptik <code>socket</code>/<code>accept</code>/<code>close</code>. <code>mirage-tcpip</code> proposes a more &quot;functional&quot; interface with a listen function that registers your callback internally. Finally, <code>mirage-tcpip</code> implements its own main loop. Of course, all this is required because we cannot switch from an <code>Unix.file_descr</code> to a <code>mirage-tcpip</code> <em>socker</em>.</p><p>In order to not lose anyone and to have a coherent understanding of what is usually done when implementing a server, we have to reimplement <code>TCP</code> and <code>TLS</code> with <code>Unix.file_descr</code> and use these modules as our transmission protocols.</p><pre><code class="ml">let handler flow =
