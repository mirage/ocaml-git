(** Negotiation engine used to fetch objects from a Git repository.

    This implementation does not have any Git logics or how to store properly a
    Git object. However, it implements the negotiation engine used to fetch
    objects from a Git repository.

    Finally, it needs fews primitives to properly receive Git objects from the
    state of a local Git repository:

    - [exists] which tells to us if an object exists or not.
    - [parents] to get parents of a commit.
    - [deref] to de-reference a given reference.
    - [locals] to get locals references of the Git repository.

    The user must give to us a light store which is able to keep some mutable
    values used by the negotiation engine.

    [find_common] talks directly to the remote Git repository. *)
