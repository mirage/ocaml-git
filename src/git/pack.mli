module MakeEntry (Hash: S.HASH): ENTRY with module Hash = Hash

(** This module is the engine to delta-ify Git objects together. The
   current implementation is a stop the world process which can not
   compute iteratively the delta-ification for some Git objects.

      This process is the biggest process about memory consumption.
   Indeed, for each computation, we need to keep some Git objects to
   get the best diff between them. As Git, this process keeps 10
   objects while we do the delta-ification for all - these objects are
   represented as inflated raw data in a {!Cstruct.t}.

      However, if we try to delta-ify big objects (like your
   repository has the season 1 of Narcos), we should explose your
   memory (because we will load 10 movies in your memory). So the
   client can restrict the delta-ification by the weigth of the window
   (which contains your objects) instead by the number of objects
   inside.

      Then, the final result does not keep Git objects loaded - the
   OCaml GC will delete them - but a lighter representation of the
   diff for each entry. And it's why, for the serialization of the
   PACK file, we re-ask (and re-load) your objects (however, in this
   last case, we don't need the ownership - see {!expect}). *)

        This is the main algorithm about the serialization of the git
        object in a PACK file. The purpose is to order and delta-ify
        entries.

        [getter] is a function to access to the real inflated raw of
        the git object requested by the hash. This function must
        allocate the raw (or let the ownership to this function). The
        algorithm takes the ownership anyway.

        [tagger] is a function to annotate an entry as preferred to
        serialize firstly.

        [window] corresponds to the number of how many object(s) we
        keep for the delta-ification or, if [memory] is [true], how
        many byte(s) we keep for the delta-ification. The client can
        control the memory consumption of this algorithm precisely if
        he wants.

        [depth] is the maximum of the delta-ification allowed.

        If you want to understand the algorithm, look the source
        code. *)
