(** Implementation of a Git stores.

    This implementation is more complete than the memory back-end because
    firstly, Git was think to be use on a file-system. Then, because for each
    operations, we let the client to control the memory consumption.

    So we provide a more powerful API which let the user to notice aready
    allocated buffers outside this scope and process some I/O operations on
    pools. *)
