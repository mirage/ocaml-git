      [?cache] is used to get directly (without de-serialization) the
      maximum size needed for the requested object (consider than is
      not the same as [hash]).

      so [raw0] and [raw1] must need to be well-sized to store all PACK
      object needed to de-serialize the requested object. Then, we
      returns an {!Object.t} which contains a [Cstruct.sub] in the
      field [Object.raw] physically equal to [raw0] or [raw1].

      The client need to notice the [tmp] and the [window] needed by
      the internal decoder {!P.t}.
