(** The {i functor} to make the OCaml representation of the Git object by a

    The constraints on git objects can cut the path to let the user to make the
    value module and keep the structural equality. If the [Hash] module is the
    same. That means:

    ```ocaml module V1 = Value.Make(SHA1)(C_inflate)(C_deflate) module V2 =
    Value.Make(SHA1)(OCaml_inflate)(OCaml_deflate) ```

    Types [V1.t] and [V2.t] are equal. *)
