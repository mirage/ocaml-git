(** The memory back-end of Git.

    The memory back-end means, we never use any I/O operations to read or write
    a Git value. All of your repository is stored on your memory. For some
    specific purposes, it's useful. However, keep in your mind, when your
    program stops, you lost your repository obviously.

    Because we don't need to handle any I/O operations, this store could be more
    fast than the Unix/Mirage store and relevant for testing. However, we still
    use the [Lwt] monad to protect mutable reference value against data-race
    condition.

    Finally, this module respects the same API {!Minimal.S} and can handle PACK
    file - and, by this way, can be used on the Smart protocol. Obviously, some
    ext. modules like INDEX could not be used with this store (because thay
    interact with a file-system back-end). *)

module Make (Digestif : Digestif.S) : sig
  type nonrec t = Digestif.t t

  include Minimal.S with type hash = Digestif.t and type t := t

  val v : ?dotgit:Fpath.t -> Fpath.t -> (t, error) result Lwt.t
  (** [create ?dotgit root] creates a new store represented by the path [root]
      (you can use [Fpath.v "."] as a sane default), where the Git objects are
      located in [dotgit] (default is [root / ".git"]). *)
end

module Store : sig

    Minimal.S with type t = Digestif.SHA1.t t and type hash = Digestif.SHA1.t

end
