      value {!t}. [?parents] should be a non-empty list and corresponds to
      a list of hashes of commits. [tree] should be a hash of a {Tree.t}
      object.

      This function does not write a new commit on the store and does
      not check the validity of [/parents] and [tree]. By this way,
      this function never fails. *)

  (** The encoder (which uses a {!Minienc.encoder}) of the Git Commit
      object. We constraint the output to be a {Cstruct.t}. This
      encoder needs the Commit OCaml value and the memory consumption
      of the encoder (in bytes). The encoder can not fail.

      NOTE: we can not unspecified the error type (it needs to be
      concrete) but, because the encoder can not fail, we define the
      error as [`Never]. *)
