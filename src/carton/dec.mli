(** Decoder of a PACK file.

    Along this module, the type [('a, 's) io] with a ['s scheduler] is needed
    for some operations (which use a {i syscall}). To be able to use them, the
    use must create a new type ['s] which represents the scheduler. To do that
    with LWT for example:

    {[
      module Lwt_scheduler = Make (Lwt)

      let scheduler =
        let open Lwt.Infix in
        let open Lwt_scheduler in
        {
          bind = (fun x f -> inj (x >>= fun x -> prj (f x)));
          return = (fun x -> inj x);
        }
    ]}

    The produced module has 2 functions [inj] and [prj] to pass from or to an
    LWT value. The user can use these functions like:

    {[
      let fiber =
        let ( >>= ) = scheduler.bind in
        let return = scheduler.return in

        weight_of_offset scheduler ~map t ~weight:null 0L >>= fun weight ->
        let raw = make_raw ~weight in
        of_offset scheduler ~map t raw ~cursor:0L in
      prj fiber ;;
      - : (Carton.v, [> error ]) Lwt.t = <abstr>
    ]} *)

    - [allocate] is an {i allocator} of underlying {i window} used to

    describes precisely what they do on [t]. *)

(** {3 Weight of object.}

    Before to extract an object, we must know resources needed to extract it.
    [weight_of_offset]/[weight_of_uid] do an simple analyse and return the
    larger length needed to store the requested object such as:

    {[
      weight_of_offset unix ~map t ~weight:null 0L >>= fun weight ->
      assert ((null :> int) <= (weight :> int)) ;
      Fmt.epr "Object at %08Lx needs %d byte(s).\n%!" 0L (weight :> int) ;
      let resource = make_raw ~weight in
      ...
    ]}

    An object can need an other object (see [OBJ_OFS_DELTA] and
    [OBJ_REF_DELTA]). In this case, the resource needed must be larger/enough to
    store both objects. So the analyse is recursive over the {i delta-chain}.

    {b Note.} If the given PACK file represented by [t] is bad, [Cycle] is
    raised. It means that an object A refers to an object B which refers to our
    last object A.

    {b Note.} This process is not {i tail-rec} and discover at each step if it
    needs to continue the {i delta-chain} or not. *)

(** [of_offset sched ~map raw ~cursor] is the object at the offset [cursor] into
    [t]. The function is not {i tail-recursive}. It discovers at each step if
    the object depends on another one (see [OBJ_REF_DELTA] or [OBJ_OFS_DELTA]).

    {b Note.} This function does not allocate larges resources (or, at least,
    only the given [allocate] function to {!t} is able to allocate a large
    resource). [raw] (which should be created with the associated {!weight}
    given by {!weight_of_offset}) is enough to extract the object. *)

(** As {!of_offset}, [of_uid sched ~map raw uid] is the object identified by
    [uid] into [t]. *)

(** {3 Path of object.}

    Due to the fact that {!of_offset}/{!of_uid} are not {i tail-rec}, an other
    solution exists to extract an object from the PACK file. However, this
    solution requires a {i meta-data} {!path} to be able to extract an object.

    A {!path} is the {i delta-chain} of the object. It assumes that a
    {i delta-chain} can not be larger than [60] (see Git assumptions). From it,
    the way to construct an object is well-know and the step to discover if an
    object depends on an other one is deleted - and we ensure that the
    reconstruction is bound over our {!path}.

    This solution fits well when we want to {i memoize} the extraction. *)

(** [kind_of_path path] returns the kind of the object associated to the given
    [path]. An assumption exists about PACK format, a {i delta-chain} refers to
    several objects which must have the same type/kind. *)

    [source] if the requested object is a patch. *)

(** {3 Uid of object.}

    Unique identifier of objects is a user-defined type which is not described
    by the format of the PACK file. By this fact, the way to {i digest} an
    object is at the user's discretion. For example, Git {i prepends} the value
    by an header such as:

    {[
      let digest v =
        let kind = match kind v with
          | `A -> "commit"
          | `B -> "tree"
          | `C -> "blob"
          | `D -> "tag" in
        let hdr = Fmt.str "%s %d\000" kind (len v) int
        let ctx = Digest.empty in
        feed_string ctx hdr ;
        feed_bigstring ctx (Bigstringaf.sub (raw v) 0 (len v)) ;
        finalize ctx
    ]}

    Of course, the user can decide how to digest a value (see {!digest}).
    However, 2 objects with the same contents but different types should have
    different unique identifier. *)

(** {3 Verify.}

    When the user get a PACK file, he must generate an IDX file (see {!Idx})
    from it - to be able to look-up objects from their [uid]. [Verify] is a
    process which try to create an OCaml representation of the IDX file. This
    process requires some information (see {!oracle}) which can be collected by
    a first analyse (see {!Fp}). Then, the process wants to take the opportunity
    to {i parallelize} extraction (depending on the {!IO} implementation). *)
