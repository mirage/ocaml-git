  (** [fetch_some git ?capabilities ~references repository] will fetch
      some remote references specified by [references].

      [references] is a map which:
      {ul
      {- the key is the {b remote} reference.}
      {- the value is a list of {b local} references - which may not
      exist yet.}}

      Then, the function will try to download all of these remote
      references and returns 2 maps:

      {ul
      {- the first map contains all local references updated by the
      new hash. This new hash is come from the server as the
      downloaded remote reference asked by the client by [references].
      Then, from associated local references with remote references,
      we updated them with the associated hash.

      For example, if [references] is:
      {[ { "refs/heads/master": [ "refs/remotes/origin/master"
                                ; "refs/heads/master" ] } ]}

      We will update (or create) "refs/remotes/origin/master" and
      "refs/heads/master" with the new hash downloaded from the remote
      reference "refs/heads/master" only if it's necessary (only if we
      did not find the hash referenced by "refs/heads/master" in the
      local store).}

      {- the second map is a {b subset} of [references] which contains
      all binder of:

      {ul
      {- remote references which does not exist on the server side.}
      {- remote references which references to an already existing in
      the local store hash.}}}}

      The client should not put the same local reference as a value of
      some remote references. The client can define non-existing
      remote references (then, they appear on the second map). The
      client can want to set non-existing local references - we will
      create them.

      If the processus encountered an error when it updates
      references, it leaves but, it did partially some update on some
      local references. *)

  val fetch_all:
    Store.t ->
    ?capabilities:Git.Capability.t list ->
    ?headers:Web.HTTP.headers ->
    references:Store.Reference.t list Store.Reference.Map.t ->
    Uri.t -> (Store.Hash.t Store.Reference.Map.t
              * Store.Reference.t list Store.Reference.Map.t
              * Store.Hash.t Store.Reference.Map.t, error) result Lwt.t
  (** [fetch_all git ?capabilities ~references repository] has the
      same semantic than {!fetch_some} for any remote references found
      on [references]. However, [fetchÂ all] will download all remote
      references available on the server (and whose hash is not
      available on the local store). If these remote references are
      not associated with some local references, we return a third map
      which contains these remote references binded with the new hash
      downloaded.

      We {b don't} notice any non-downloaded remote references not
      found on the [references] map and whose hash already exists on
      the local store.

      Then, the client can bind these new hashes with specific local
      references or just give up. *)

  val fetch_one:
    Store.t ->
    ?capabilities:Git.Capability.t list ->
    ?headers:Web.HTTP.headers ->
    reference:(Store.Reference.t * Store.Reference.t list) ->
    Uri.t -> ([ `AlreadySync | `Sync of Store.Hash.t Store.Reference.Map.t ], error) result Lwt.t
  (** [fetch_one git ?capabilities ~reference repository] is a
      specific call of {!fetch_some} with only one reference. Then, it
      retuns:

      {ul
      {- [`AlreadySync] if the hash of the requested reference already
      exists on the local store}
      {- [`Sync updated] if we downloaded [new_hash] and
      set [local_ref] with this new hash.}} *)

  val clone:
    Store.t ->
    ?capabilities:Git.Capability.t list ->
    ?headers:Web.HTTP.headers ->
    reference:(Store.Reference.t * Store.Reference.t) ->
    Uri.t -> (unit, error) result Lwt.t

  val update_and_create: Store.t ->
    ?capabilities:Git.Capability.t list ->
    ?headers:Web.HTTP.headers ->
    references:Store.Reference.t list Store.Reference.Map.t-> Uri.t ->
    ((Store.Reference.t, Store.Reference.t * string) result list, error) result Lwt.t
    (** As {!fetch_some}, [update git ?capabilities ~references
        repository] is the other side of the communication with a Git
        server and update and create remote references when it
        uploads local hashes.

        [reference] is a map which:
        {ul
        {- the key is the {b local} reference.}
        {- the value is a list of {b remote} references - which may
        not exist yet.}}

        Then, the function will try to upload all of these local
        references to the binded remote references. If binded remote
        reference does not exist on the server, we ask to the server
        to create and set it to the local hash.

        For each update action, we check if the local store has the
        remote hash. In other case, we miss this action - that means,
        the local store is not synchronized with the server (and the
        client probably needs to {!fetch_some} before).

        Then, it returns a list of results. The [Ok] case with the
        remote reference which the server updated correctly and the
        [Error] case with the remote reference which the server
        encountered an error with a description of this error.

        At this final stage, the function does not encountered any
        error during the commmunication - if it's the case, we did not
        do any modification on the server and return an {!error}. *)
