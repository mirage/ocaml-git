# 1.4.11
* Add `User-Agent` in the headers of the smart HTTP protocol. This
  makes `bitbucket.org` happy. (#66, patch from @vklquevs)

## 1.4.10
* Fix support for the smart HTTP protocol (report by @talex5,
  mirage/irmin#138)

## 1.4.9
* Remove the `OGITTMPDIR` and alway store temp files under
  `git/tmp` (mirage/irmin#132)

## 1.4.8
* Fix LRU cache: SHA1 should be unique in the cache (regression
  introduced in 1.4.3). This was causing confusing read results
  under load.
* Reading objects now updates the LRU cache
* Fix a regression in `ogit cat-file` which were displaying nothing
  for small objects.

## 1.4.7
* Fix the filesystem updates for non-bare repositories (reported by @avsm)
* `Git.write_index` now takes an optional `index` argument
* Index entries should be fixed alphabetically
* Remove raw printf (#60)
* More flexibility on where to write temp files. The directory name can be
  configured by write calls, and the default is `OGITTMPDIR` if set,
  then `Filename.get_temp_dir_name` -- as it was in 1.4.5, see #51

## 1.4.6
* Expose `Git.Value.Cache.set_size` to change the LRU cache size
* Reduce the default LRU cache size (in 1.4.4 it was set to 64k, now it's 512)
* More precise type for commit dates
* Add `git.top` to load toplevel printers for Git values

## 1.4.5
* Support `packed-refs` files, to read references packed by `git gc` (reported
  by Gregory Tsipenyuk)
* Fix the filesystem backend when TMPDIR is not on the same partition as the
  Git repository (#51, patch from @vklquevs)

## 1.4.4
* Support the smart HTTP Git protocol (#26)
* Best-effort creation of files when expanding the index into the filesystem:
  Skip the invalid filenames and continue. Users are expected to sanitize
  their filenames if they want to use a non-bare repository (#11)
* Overwrite changed file when expanding the index into the filesystem (#4)
* Do not recompute the hash of blob files when expanding the index into the
  filesystem. This help fixing a speed issue with non-bare repo with lots of
  file.
* Rename `{write,read}_cache` to `{write,read}_index`
* Rename Cache to Index
* Expose the protocol capabilities to the client
* Support side-band-64k protocol capability (#44)
* Fix support for git+ssh (#39)
* Expose zlib compression level (#41)
* Maintain a cache of opened files (#29, Pierre Chambart)

## 1.4.3 (2014-12-19)
* Fix regression introduced in 1.4.3 appearing when synchronising big
  repositories (#38)
* Fix concurrent read/write by using an atomic rename (#35)
* Tree objects can also point to commits (@codinuum)
* Reduce allocation (@codinuum)
* Use LRU cache instead of an unbounde Hashtbl (code imported for
  Simon Cruanes's CCache implementation)
* Remove the crazy unbounded caching in Git.FS. Use the LRU everywhere (#22)
* Fix fd leaking (#29)
* Update to dolog.1.0
* Remove dependency to camlp4
* Remove lots of warnings
* Move `Git_unix` and `Git_mirage` in their own subdirs as it was causing issues
  to oasis (#5, Simon Cruanes)
* Use `Bytes` instead of `String` (#5, Simon Cruanes)

## 1.4.2 (2014-12-14)
* Fix `Git_unix.IO.write_file` to work on empty files

## 1.4.1 (2014-12-4)
* Fix `ogit --version` (#22)
* Expose the backend type
* Expose Git_unix.Sync.IO

## 1.4.0 (2014-11-20):
* Port to Conduit 0.6.0 API.
* Depend on `ocaml-hex`

## 1.3.0 (2014-10-16)
* Remove the dependency on `core_kernel`
* Use `ocaml-nocrypto` instead of `ocaml-sha1`

## 1.2.0: (2014-06-10)
* Can consume Mirage's `V1_LWT.FS` signature to generate a
  persistent store. This allows to store Git repos directly
  inside raw block devices (no need of filesystem anymore).
* Minor API refactoring to abstract the Unix layer cleanly.
* Expose a filesystem functor to create filesystem backends
  independent of Unix.
* Simplify the ocamlfind packages: there's only `git` and `git.unix`.

## 1.1.0: (2014-06-02)
* Support for push (not optimized at all)
* Fix the generation of `.dot` file representing the Git repo
* Fix serialization of executable files in the cache
* Fix reading the total number of keys in a pack index file
* Use `ocaml-conduit` to set-up connections with remote repositories
* USe `ocaml-uri` to specify Git Remote Identifiers
* Depend the implementation of patience diff in pure OCaml (unused for now)

## 1.0.2: (2014-04-19)
* Catch, improve and propagate Zlib inflation errors (which usually pop-ups
  on incomplete files)

## 1.0.1: (2014-04-10)
* Escape invalid chars in path names
* Do not link with camlp4 when using as a libray

## 1.0.0: (2014-02-10)
* Support for reading and writing pack indexes
* Support for reading and writing pack files
* Refactor the API: each Git object has now its own file, with a consistent
  signature
* `ogit clone` now correctly set-up the cache file (which means that
  `git status` and `git diff` will now work as expected on a repository created
   by `ogit`)
* Add `ogit read-tree COMMIT`
* Add `ogit ls-files [--all]`
* Support for reading and writing cache files

## 0.10.2: (2014-01-20)
* Strip the contents of references file
* Improve the pretty-printing of SHA1 values
* Add some info message when reading files in the local backend

## 0.10.1: (2014-01-15)
* Add missing files (fix build)
* Add `GitTypes.S.mem_reference`
* Add `GitTypes.S.remove_reference`
* Add `GitTypes.S.mem` to check if an object exists in the store

## 0.10.0: (2014-01-14)
* Support for in-memory stores
* Add `ogit cat-file`
* Add `ogit ls-remote`
* Add `ogit fetch`
* Add `ogit clone`
* Switch non-blocking IO using Lwt

## 0.9.0: (2014-01-04)
* Initial release
