### 1.11.3 (2017-11-20)

- add ocplib-endian to dependencies of git (#233, @hannesm)

### 1.11.2 (2017-08-02)

- Update to conduit.1.0 and cohttp.0.99 (#226, @samoht)

### 1.11.1 (2017-07-25)

- [git-unix] Fix linking issue of the `ogit` binary on some package
  configurations (#225, @samoht)

### 1.11.0 (2016-06-01)

* Add `ogit add-commit-parent` to add a new parent to a given commit
  (#208, @samoht)
* port to jbuilder (#209, @samoht)
* port to mtime 1.0 (#212, @dinosaure and @samoht)
* use Decompress instead of camlzip (#211, @dinosaure and @samoht)

### 1.10.1 (2017-04-15)

* Improve API docs (#201, @olleolleolle)
* Compat with cmdliner 1.0 (#202, @samoht)
* Fix typos and links in docs (@smeruelo and @olleolleolle)

### 1.10.0 (2017-02-15)

* Adapt to Mirage3 (@samoht, @avsm, @yomimono, @hannesm)
* Add IO.test_and_set to automatically update references (#185, @samoht)
* Better Windows support (#187, @samoht)
  - unix: Translate Git references into valid Windows filenames
  - fix/work-around upstream issues to make the tests pass on Windows
* Split the package into 4 packages: `git`, `git-http`, `git-unix` and
  `git-mirage` (#189, @samoht)

### 1.9.3 (2016-11-09)

* Turn a bunch of info message into debug statements (#169, @samoht)

### 1.9.2 (2016-10-16)

* Do not depend on `ocaml-crc` anymore: less C code means, easier to
  port to other MirageOS backends (#166, @g2p)

### 1.9.1 (2016-10-04)

* Cache all intermediate values when expending packed values. This
  speeds-up pack access quite a lot in practice, especially when the
  pack files are big (#163)

### 1.9.0 (2016-09-30)

* Use safe-string (#160, @samoht)
* Support camlzip 1.06 (#160, @samoht)
* Use topkg, remove pack (#158, @samoht)

### 1.8.0 (2016-05-03)

* References can point to non-commit hashes (#123, @samoht)
* Rename `Git.SHA` into `Git.Hash` (@samoht)
* Remove `Git.Sync.populate` but add `Git.Sync.clone` to replace the
  previous `fetch+populate` (#122, @samoht)
* Fix the API so that references can point to any kind of hashes (#123, @samoht)
* Fix duplicated references when mixing packed and loose references
  (#124, @samoht)
* Use astring, logs and fmt (@samoht)
* Add `Store.size`. Before, the only way to get the size of a file was to
  decompress the whole thing. The main win comes from getting the size of raw
  packed objects without decompressing. (#143, @talex5)
* Workaround a memory leak in lwt: See ocsigen/lwt#229, which caused
  `IO.rec_file` and thus the watch mechanism on Unix to leak memory
  (#146, @samoht)
* Fix performance regression when reading large files (#147, @chambart)

### 1.7.3 (2016-02-19)

* Git_unix now works on MinGW

### 1.7.2 (2016-01-21)

* Do not mmap files, as there is no way to easily control the unmap
  of bigarrays. This remove EMFILE errors under load (#133, @talex5)
* Fix comparison of entries in the index file. This fix a random issue
  which might happen when entries in a pack file are checkout and
  updated (@samoht)

### 1.7.1 (2015-08-10)

* Support cohtpp 0.19.1. (#119, @rgrinberg)
* Revert API break for the Sync functor. Now still takes only a `Store.S`
  as parameter. (#120)

### 1.7.0 (2015-08-06)

* Changes to the `Search` API:
  - Remove `find_exn`
  - the type `t` has a new case `Tree_root` to represent tree roots
  - the type `path` is now structured (not a list of strings anymore).
    this removes the confusing semantics of empty strings in paths.

* Changes to the `Global_graph` API:
  - `closure` takes an optional `full` argument to work over
    commit objects only
  - All the arguments of `pack` are labelled and its result type
    has changed.
  - Add `keys` to return the topological sort of keys in the graph.


* Improve the size of pack files received when fetching (#115)
  - advertise the fact that `ocaml-git` clients support `ofs-delta`
    and `thin-pack`
  - Compute a minimal set of `haves` to send to the server after
    the discovery phase, where we already know all the server
    references (#114)

* Unpack shallow pack files after a fetch
* Full support for shallow packs (#81)
* During fetch, we now respect the "allow-reachable-sha1-in-want"
  server (non-)capability. A proper error is reported to the client
  if that's not the case.
* Parametrize the codebase over the Inflate implementation. Useful
  to change the inflate algorithm (or to not use any at all, which
  would be what we want for big files and/or for efficient writes)
  and to simplify the port to other backends. `Store.S` implementations
  now expose their `Inflate` implementation.
* Parametrize the codebase over the SHA implementation. Useful to change
  the SHA algorihm (the unix backend provides SHA256) or simplify the
  port to other backends (the mirage backend uses a pure OCaml implementation
  extracted from uuidm). `Store.S` implementations now expose their `Digest`
  implementation (#68)

* Better sync API (#113)
  - Change the arguments of `Sync.fetch`
  - Remove `Sync.clone`
  - Add `Sync.populate` to be called after a fetch to properly populate
    the local Git repository (similar to what `git clone` does).
  - Add `ogit clone --no-checkout` and make `ogit clone --bare` more similar
    to the same `git` command.

* Support Github http(s) URLs without .git (#111)
* Add a `dot_git` optional parameter to `Store.create` to specify where
  the Git metadata should be stored (default is still `<root>/.git`). This
  is useful to properly support `bare` repositories (#110)
* Full support for 32 bit platform (ie. continue the patch started in 1.6.2).
* Rework the `Git.Pack` and `Git.Pack_index` API to speed-up random access.
* Add a `Git.SHA.Array` module to work with contiguous arrays of SHA1.
* Rename `Git.SHA.lenght` to `Git.SHA.hex_length` to avoid confusion.
* Expose `Git.SHA.of_short_hex` to create short hashes. `Git.SHA.of_hex` now
  only accept 40 characters hexa-decimal strings.
* Improve the output of `ogit clone` by showing progress when the pack file
  is downloaded and when the delta are resolved.

### 1.6.2 (2015-07-16)

* Support 32 bit platform by avoiding creating large strings. This also improve
  the performance of reading and synchronizin large pack files
  (#103, #105 @gregtatcam)

### 1.6.1 (2015-07-14)

* Fix a bug in `ogit pull` using the smart HTTP protocol when the HTTP temporary
  buffer could sometimes be overfill.
* Avoid closing twice the same fd in the smart HTTP protocol.
* Avoid the GC to close a fd while we are still using a channel built on top of
  it -- this affects the smart HTTP protocol only.
* Add an opam file for the `mirage-git` package.

### 1.6.0 (2015-07-11)

* Allow some references to contain pointer to other references (#96)
* Improve the support for 32bit architectures (#97)
* Add `Reference.pp_head_contents` and `Reference.equal_head_contents`.
* Remove `Store.clear` and replace it by `Memory.clear`, `Memory.clear_all`
  and `FS.remove`. This let users have a finer control over the memory
  consumption of the program over time (related to #90)
* Rename all `pp_hum` functions into `pp`.
* Fix regression in `Sync.fetch` and add unit-tests (running only in slow mode).
* Fix reading of `.git/HEAD` when the contents is a commit hash.
* Depends on `Stringext` for all the extra string function needed.

### 1.5.3 (2015-07-10)

* Fix listing of packed references (#98)

* Remove the dependency to OUnit for the tests
* Improve the pretty printers and the output of `ogit`

### 1.5.1 (2015-06-18)

  a directory name becomes a file name (#87)
* Fix the order of entries in the tree objects (#86)
* Fix the compilation of tests (#85)
* Fetch all remote refs on synchronize (#83, by @AltGr)

### 1.5.0 (2015-06-12)

* Compatibility with `cohttp.0.18.` (#80 by @rgrinberg)
* Simplify the mirage sync API to use `conduit 0.8.4` (breaking API changes)
* Change `ogit cat-file` to behave exactly as `git cat-file`
  The previous command is renamed to `ogit cat` (#75 by @codinuum)
* `ogit` now supports short hashes instead of full SHA1 (#75 by @codinuum)
* Add `Git.Pack.Raw.read` to read raw pack files (#75 by @codinuum)
* `Git.Pack_index.t` now uses a cache of entries. This is more efficient
  than the previous representation (#75 by @codinuum)
* Add `Git.Pack_index.mem` to find an entry in the pack index cache
  (#75 by @codinuum)
* Add `Git.Pack_index.find_offset` to find an offset in the pack index
  cache (#75 by @codinuum)
* Add `Git.Packed_value.to_value` to unpack a value stored in a pack file
  (#75 by @codinuum)
* Support synchronisation for MirageOS unikernels (#70)

### 1.4.11 (2015-03-11)

* Fix multi round-trips in the smart HTTP protocol. This fixes
  depth-limited clones (#71) and fetches.
* Create the `git.http` library for abstracting away bits of the
  smart HTTP protocol.
* Add `User-Agent` in the headers of the smart HTTP protocol. This
  makes `bitbucket.org` happy. (#66, patch from @vklquevs)

### 1.4.10 (2015-02-05)

* Fix support for the smart HTTP protocol (report by @talex5,
  mirage/irmin#138)

### 1.4.9 (2015-02-04)

* Remove the `OGITTMPDIR` and alway store temp files under
  `git/tmp` (mirage/irmin#132)

### 1.4.8 (2015-02-04)

* Fix LRU cache: SHA1 should be unique in the cache (regression
  introduced in 1.4.3). This was causing confusing read results
  under load.
* Reading objects now updates the LRU cache
* Fix a regression in `ogit cat-file` which were displaying nothing
  for small objects.

### 1.4.7 (2015-02-03)

* Fix the filesystem updates for non-bare repositories (reported by @avsm)
* `Git.write_index` now takes an optional `index` argument
* Index entries should be fixed alphabetically
* Remove raw printf (#60)
* More flexibility on where to write temp files. The directory name can be
  configured by write calls, and the default is `OGITTMPDIR` if set,
  then `Filename.get_temp_dir_name` -- as it was in 1.4.5, see #51

### 1.4.6 (2015-01-29)

* Expose `Git.Value.Cache.set_size` to change the LRU cache size
* Reduce the default LRU cache size (in 1.4.4 it was set to 64k, now it's 512)
* More precise type for commit dates
* Add `git.top` to load toplevel printers for Git values

### 1.4.5 (2015-01-19)

* Support `packed-refs` files, to read references packed by `git gc` (reported
  by Gregory Tsipenyuk)
* Fix the filesystem backend when TMPDIR is not on the same partition as the
  Git repository (#51, patch from @vklquevs)

### 1.4.4 (2015-01-12)

* Support the smart HTTP Git protocol (#26)
* Best-effort creation of files when expanding the index into the filesystem:
  Skip the invalid filenames and continue. Users are expected to sanitize
  their filenames if they want to use a non-bare repository (#11)
* Overwrite changed file when expanding the index into the filesystem (#4)
* Do not recompute the hash of blob files when expanding the index into the
  filesystem. This help fixing a speed issue with non-bare repo with lots of
  file.
* Rename `{write,read}_cache` to `{write,read}_index`
* Rename Cache to Index
* Expose the protocol capabilities to the client
* Support side-band-64k protocol capability (#44)

  repositories (#38)
* Fix concurrent read/write by using an atomic rename (#35)
* Tree objects can also point to commits (@codinuum)
* Reduce allocation (@codinuum)
* Use LRU cache instead of an unbounde Hashtbl (code imported for
  Simon Cruanes's CCache implementation)
* Remove the crazy unbounded caching in Git.FS. Use the LRU everywhere (#22)
* Fix fd leaking (#29)
* Update to dolog.1.0
* Remove dependency to camlp4
* Remove lots of warnings
* Move `Git_unix` and `Git_mirage` in their own subdirs as it was causing issues
  to oasis (#5, Simon Cruanes)
* Use `Bytes` instead of `String` (#5, Simon Cruanes)

### 1.4.0 (2014-11-20)

* Port to Conduit 0.6.0 API.
* Depend on `ocaml-hex`

### 1.3.0 (2014-10-16)

* Remove the dependency on `core_kernel`
* Use `ocaml-nocrypto` instead of `ocaml-sha1`

### 1.2.0: (2014-06-10)

* Can consume Mirage's `V1_LWT.FS` signature to generate a
  persistent store. This allows to store Git repos directly
  inside raw block devices (no need of filesystem anymore).
* Minor API refactoring to abstract the Unix layer cleanly.
* Expose a filesystem functor to create filesystem backends
  independent of Unix.
* Simplify the ocamlfind packages: there's only `git` and `git.unix`.

### 1.1.0: (2014-06-02)

* Support for push (not optimized at all)
* Fix the generation of `.dot` file representing the Git repo
* Fix serialization of executable files in the cache

* Depend the implementation of patience diff in pure OCaml (unused for now)

### 1.0.2: (2014-04-19)

* Catch, improve and propagate Zlib inflation errors (which usually pop-ups
  on incomplete files)

### 1.0.1: (2014-04-10)

* Escape invalid chars in path names
* Do not link with camlp4 when using as a libray

### 1.0.0: (2014-02-10)

* Support for reading and writing pack indexes
* Support for reading and writing pack files
* Refactor the API: each Git object has now its own file, with a consistent
  signature
* `ogit clone` now correctly set-up the cache file (which means that
  `git status` and `git diff` will now work as expected on a repository created
   by `ogit`)
* Add `ogit read-tree COMMIT`
* Add `ogit ls-files [--all]`
* Support for reading and writing cache files
